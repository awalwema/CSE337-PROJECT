Functional parts


All basic static pages work: home.php, aboutus.php, contactus.php

A user account can be created asking for the user's first name, last name, password, and zip code.

Login/logout capabilites work.


-------------------------------------
Tasks needed to do:

The skeletal framework of the website is mostly finished.
We need to make dummy data for our providers and then implement
the core of the website by integrating the database information
and displaying it onto our homepage.
